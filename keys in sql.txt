KEYS IN SQL

1)super key: an attribute or a set of attributes that can be used to identify row of data in a table is a super key.
A key which uniquely identify each record.
Example:
StudentId,   RollNo,    SubjectId,
All of three are unique , we can select one or all of them as to identify each record uniquely.

2)candidate key(primary key) : minimal subset of super key.
Example: we can use StudentId or RollNo or StudentId to uniquely identify each record.

3)Alternate key : all rest columns are alternate keys except primary key.

4)composite key:A composite key, in the context of relational databases, 
is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table. 
Example: StudentId and SubjectId togather act as composite keys.

5)surrogate key: there are some cases where there is no unique key in the table. In that case we can add a key which uniquely
identify each record.
Example: person_name, person_location
here we can add person_id to uniquely identify each record.

6)foreign key: it refers the primary key.
