VIEWS IN INDEX
->view are virtual table does not exist in real in db.
->when we join two tables we get the output table with no name , to give name to that table we can use view.

1)Creating View:
Syntax:create view view_name;

using single table:
create view show_data as
select name,rollno from student 
where id>20;

using multiple table:
create view as jointableview as
select name,subject,rollno from student,subject
where student.id=subject.id;

the above query is simply a natural join.

2)selecting view:
>select * from jointableview;

3)dropping view:
>drop view view_name;
